         Reach the goals 
	  </h1>
	  <p>
		My life has been a trade-off
		</p> 
		<p>
		If I wanted to reach the goals I set for myself, I had to get at it and stay at it everyday.
		</p>
		<p>
		I had to think about it all the time . 
		</p>
		<p>
		I had to get up everyday with my mind set on improving something.
		</p>
		<p>
		I was driven by a desire to always be on the top of the heap.
